            <h3>Types of Yoga ?</h3>
            <p><b>There are several types of yoga, each with unique practices and benefits. Here are some of the most popular types:</b></p>
            <h4>1. Hatha Yoga</h4>
            <p><b>Hatha yoga is the most common form, emphasizing physical postures, or "asanas," and controlled breathing techniques. It’s great for beginners because it introduces basic yoga poses with a focus on alignment and relaxation.</b></p>
            <h4>2. Vinyasa Yoga</h4>
            <p><b>Known for its fluid, movement-based sequences, Vinyasa yoga links breath with movement, creating a dynamic and often challenging practice. Each pose flows smoothly into the next, making it an ideal style for those who enjoy a more active form of yoga.</b></p>
            <h4>3. Ashtanga Yoga</h4>
            <p><b>Ashtanga yoga follows a specific sequence of poses, often practiced in a fast-paced, physically demanding way. It emphasizes strength, flexibility, and endurance, making it ideal for those seeking a rigorous workout.</b></p>
            <h4>4. Kundalini Yoga</h4>
            <p><b>Kundalini yoga focuses on releasing energy from the base of the spine, known as "kundalini energy." It incorporates chanting, meditation, and dynamic breathing exercises, creating a deeply spiritual and energetic experience.</b></p>
            <h4>5. Yin Yoga</h4>
            <p><b>Yin yoga is a slow-paced practice where poses are held for extended periods, targeting the deep connective tissues in the body. This practice promotes flexibility and relaxation, making it ideal for people looking to unwind and stretch deeply.</b></p>
            <h4>6. Bikram Yoga</h4>
            <p><b>Often practiced in a heated room, Bikram yoga follows a set sequence of 26 postures designed to flush toxins and increase flexibility. It’s physically intense but can be highly rewarding for those looking to detoxify the body.</b></p>
            <h4>7. Restorative Yoga</h4>
            <p><b>Restorative yoga uses props to support the body, allowing practitioners to relax and hold poses longer. It focuses on healing and relaxing, making it perfect for those recovering from injuries or looking for a gentle, relaxing practice.</b></p>
